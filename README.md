# Detection-and-Classification-of-mental-stress-for-prognosis-of-anxiety-levels

Introduction:
 Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, and timely identification of stress and anxiety levels is vital for effective intervention. This research project focuses on developing a robust framework for the categorization of mental states and stress levels. We aim to leverage the RESpiban device, specifically designed for chest-based monitoring, to obtain a comprehensive dataset related to respiratory patterns. Additionally, heart rate variability (HRV) indices from the Swell dataset will complement our study, providing valuable insights into heart rate fluctuations to get a real time analysis of the anxiety levels of a person
Gaps:
Despite the increasing awareness of mental health issues, there remains a gap in the early prognosis and precise categorization of anxiety levels. Existing methods often lack the integration of multiple physiological signals and real-time monitoring capabilities. This research seeks to address these gaps by combining respiratory and heart rate data, enhancing the accuracy of anxiety level predictions in a Real time environment
Objectives:
1.	Data Acquisition: Collect a dataset, from the Respiban device, capturing respiratory patterns and stress-related information from the chest. Simultaneously, gather HRV indices, focusing on heart rate variations during different mental states.
2.	Categorization Framework: Develop a four-step classification system to categorize mental states and stress levels based on labels the acquired respiratory and HRV data. The aim is to create a nuanced model that differentiates between varying levels of anxiety.
In developing the four-step classification system for mental states and stress levels using respiratory and HRV data, specific labels have been defined to capture the nuances of emotional states. The baseline category represents an individual's normal, relaxed state, providing a reference point with steady respiratory patterns and stable heart rate variability. The neutral state signifies emotional equilibrium, while amusement reflects a positive emotional state, and stress is crucial for identifying heightened distress. Incorporating these labels enhances the model's ability to differentiate subtle variations, allowing for a more accurate and nuanced assessment of an individual's mental well-being. These defined labels serve as vital reference points for training neural networks and machine learning models, enabling them to effectively recognize and categorize diverse mental states and stress levels within the acquired datasets
3.	Application of Neural Networks and Machine Learning Models: Implement Neural Networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and machine learning algorithms like K â€“ Nearest Neighbours to analyse the complex patterns within the datasets. These models will play a crucial role in identifying subtle variations indicative of different mental states and stress levels.
